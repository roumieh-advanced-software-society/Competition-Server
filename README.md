# Competition-Server
This server was used to host a CTF-style competition within RASS. It supports:
 - Logins/Accounts.
 - A UI with 3 sections, each section containing 3 questions, and 2 "hidden" questions. Each question/section can be individually locked/unlocked. 
 - Answers verification and a score system.
It was built with Angular and Flask, and accesses a Postgre database.
